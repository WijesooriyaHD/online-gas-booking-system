# online-gas-booking-system
The objective of this project is to create a system where the customer can easily book their LPG gas cylinder through an online system and the agency can track the record of its customer and the delivery of the cylinders in a particular area.<br>
There are various steps to book a gas like issuing an entry book, to 
travel agency from that to go to the delivery centre, our system makes 
this whole process at one place. Basically, there are two types of users 
for the cylinders domestic and other is commercial. <br> <br>
The system will help the customers by providing a simple user 
interactive interface for booking the gas through online which will save 
their time and money. Through this system, we solve the customersâ€™ 
problems in a lot of way like to book their gas cylinder from home 
without travelling to the agency and stand in a queue to just book the 
gas. The order is for two purposes as domestic and commercial. The 
billing is done based on the above two categories and the rate is 
charged. Then the stock of cylinders is also maintained in manual 
records. In this system the payment for the gas cylinders is not done 
by online. The customer can do the payment in cash to the delivery 
boy (for domestic orders) or by check to the sales manager (for 
commercial orders) when the delivery is done. <br> <br>
It also gives the agencies ease by helping them make the booking 
process faster and easier to maintain. It will avoid the agency from 
spending a huge amount of their budget in maintaining the manual 
records and updating them from time to time. As the customer moves 
from another city its records can be easily transferred or deleted from 
the record.
